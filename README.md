# Amazon Price Tracker

This is a simple Amazon Price Tracker Project made using Selenium and Python(3.8.5). This tracker will ask for product details like **Name of product**, **Minimum Price** and **Maximum Price** and then scrape the Amazon India website to find all the products matching your requirement.
Then it will generate a JSON report having all the details containing the **price**, **link**, **product id**, **seller name**, etc.

# Quick Start

* Install all the required libraries using the pip command : 

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Download the latest Chrome WebDriver from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

* Start the tracker using the command : 

    `py tracker.py`
